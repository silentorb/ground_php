Ground is a server-side, schema-based framework for data modeling.  It is sort of an ORM, though it avoids certain features ORMs contain, and in return contains certain features ORMs normally don't have.  Ground is designed to be used in the larger context of the Vineyard framework, though much of Ground can be utilized without Vineyard.
